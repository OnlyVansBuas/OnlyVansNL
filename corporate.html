			 <h4>User interface patterns</h4>
			   <p>Our website uses several user interface (UI) patterns to create an intuitive and engaging experience for visitors. At the top, the navigation bar allows users to quickly find and access important sections of the site. The hero section always includes a brief introduction and, on some secondary pages (e. g. <a href="upgradepack.html">Upgrade Packages</a> ) a relevant image to grab attention and set the tone for the content, also showing separation from the main pages. The carousel on the <a href="vanspiration.html">Vanspiration</a> page displays multiple pieces of content in a visually appealing and interactive way, making it easy for users to browse ideas or inspirations. Cards are used to display <a href="ourRoadStory.html">Team Members</a> and <a href="pimpYourVan.html">Offerings</a>, offering an organized way to present information that is easy to scan and interact with to navigate smoother and more independently. These patterns such as the <strong>navigation bar, hero section, carousel, and cards</strong>, help users navigate the site smoothly, find what they need quickly, and engage with the content in a visually clear and attractive way.</p>
			  
            <h4>The structure of the navigation and content</h4>
			  <p>The structure of our website is designed to be simple, intuitive, and engaging for our audience. It starts with a navigation bar at the top of every page for easy access to key sections. The homepage features a engaging brief introduction about our brand and a button to explore further. This takes users to the <a href="ourRoadStory.html">Our Road Story</a> page, where we display our brand's values and mission in form of storytelling.</p>
			  <p>On the navigation bar, users can than access the <a href="pimpYourVan.html">Pim Your Van</a> page, the section that showcases users our brand's different offerings in cards for simple navigation. By clicking in one of those cards users are redirected for pages with more information about our offerings (e.g.<a href="upgradepack.html">Upgrade Packages</a>). All this pages end with a Contact section where visitors can send us a message about their vans.</p>
			  <p>In the <a href="vanspiration.html">Vanspiration</a> page users can easily see more of what we do as a brand and get inspired for possible updates on their own vans.The last page is the <a href="faq.html">FAQ YEAH</a> page where we display Frequently Asked Questions to help users and possibly save time in sending us a message. This page also ends with a contact form for questions that are not answered in the page.</p>
			  
			<h4>How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand</h4>
			  <p>The website design captures the brand’s personality by mixing a retro, nostalgic vibe with modern elements to create a unique and engaging experience that reflects our values. This retro style connects with the target audience's love for their past memories while celebrating the freedom and individuality that comes with camper van culture. The design is visually dynamic, using vibrant and vintage colors together with images and illustration to evoke a sense of warmth and familiarity, while still feeling. All pages are designed to invite users to explore and feel a personal connection with the brand, reflecting both the freedom of the van life and a love for personal expression.</p>
			  
			<h4>How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy</h4>
			  <p>The website design matches our marketing and social media strategy. The colors, fonts, and images we use are the same across both the website and our social media posts. This makes it easier for people to go from our social media to our website and feel like they’re still experiencing the same brand. Keeping everything consistent is important for building recognition. Our social media is made to grab the attention of our target audience, so when they visit the website, the same vibe and message should be there to keep them engaged and remind them why they came. Our social media strategy is also focused less on giving detailed information about the brand and its offerings. So, we believe that people who come from there are looking for more details. That’s why we focus on providing the most important pages of the website, like the home page and <a href="ourRoadStory.html">Our Road Story</a> page, which is where the <a href="index.html">Homepage</a> button takes you. Our goal is to make sure the information they want is easy to find and keeps them engaged.</p>
			  
			<h4>How does website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product</h4>
			  <p>The website design effectively showcases our unique value proposition through the chosen images, colors, and the intuitive layout. The visuals reflect our core values with a retro-inspired vibe that gives a sense of adventure and freedom. The use of contrasting colors adds energy and excitement, and also makes our key messages stand out. The easy navigation gives users a sense of control, allowing them to explore the site at their own pace. Additionally, the <a href="vanspiration.html">Vanspiration</a> page encourages visitors to envision the possibilities for their own vans, further aligning with the idea of transformation and personalization.</p>

          <ul>
			  <h4>Testing Goals </h4>
			   <p>Our testing goals were to check if the website was easy to use, if users could quickly understand what we offer, and if the overall design and layout helped guide them through the pages smoothly. We wanted to make sure the site's style matched our brand and our values.</p>
			  
			  <h4>Testing Methods </h4>
			  <p>When it came time for testing, we couldn’t find participants that fully matched our target group, so we reached out to people close to us who had no prior knowledge of the brand or product. Two of the participants were women aged 20 and 19 (Beatriz and Sofia), and one other man, Jenö. The testing took place outside of campus. Although they weren’t part of our exact target audience, they still gave us valuable feedback on the website. All participants tested the site on both desktop and mobile devices. </p>
			  
			   <h4>Testing Protocol </h4>
			  <p>For the testing, we gave the participants a brief overview of what our brand is about, explaining the main topics, and then allowed them to navigate the website on their own. One team member took notes during the process. Caa be found here: <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/234371_buas_nl/EX_iVMHOq6NHoPdCPOYsKYgBdCrK2ZNwFd-8-iPrDXa2vg?e=WNcFTW">Notes</a>  </p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
			  
          <p>Our brand focuses on van upgrades for people who love their vans but need small improvements to keep them running and preserve the memories they’ve made. According to World Today News (2023), van ownership among young people has increased by 53% between 2020 and 2023. Ibrahim (2024) also highlights the rise of the "van life" trend, showing that more young adults are buying vans,often older ones, because they’re more affordable. We believe this shift in the market has created a new target group that’s currently underserved.</p>
		
		   <p>Our audience is mainly people aged 25 to 35. Some have owned their vans for years and want to hold onto the memories, while others are new owners who want to personalize their vans to reflect their identity. Our marketing message is centered around this connection: your van is more than just an object, it’s part of who you are. If you’re adventurous, expressive, or rebellious, your van should be too. By upgrading your van, you’re not just fixing it, you’re giving it a second life with even more meaningful stories.</p>
		
		 <p>As a small and new brand, it’s important for us to <strong>stand out</strong>. That’s why our communication style is creative, playful, and sometimes even risky. We want to grab attention and make people feel something. By using humor and a unique tone of voice, we create content that connects with our audience and makes us memorable in a market full of similar-looking brands.</p>
		
		<h4>Channels</h4>
		
          <p>Using TikTok and Instagram is essential for reaching our target audience of 25–35-year-olds. Both platforms have a strong presence among this age group (Billo, 2025). TikTok's algorithm favors discovery, allowing our content to reach new users organically, while Instagram's features enable us to build a consistent brand presence. By leveraging both platforms, we can effectively engage our audience and promote our brand's message.</p>

			  <p><strong>Week 1(24/03 - 30/03)</strong></p>
			  <p><strong>Our Actions</strong></p>
			  <p>For our first campaign week, our goal was to introduce the brand to a new audience. We did this by showcasing our logo and visual style. Since our brand name sounds similar to a well-known company, we used that as an advantage by adding a touch of satirical humor to our post. Based on insights from our interviews and research by Social Pilot (2025), we chose to post at 2 PM, an ideal time for reaching our audience. Even though according to Kontentino (2024) brands should post between 2 and 4 posts (a strategy we will implement later), for this week, we focused on one strong post, shared across both Instagram and TikTok.</p>

			   <p><strong>What We Learned</strong></p>
			  <p>We were positively surprised by the results of our first campaign week. TikTok especially stood out, none of us had experience using it for marketing, yet the post reached a large audience. One key insight we gained was the clear difference between TikTok and Instagram. While TikTok made it easier to get views, engagement levels were noticeably lower than on Instagram. We also realized that our initial objectives were more achievable than expected. Already reaching them on TikTok after the first post</p>
			  
			    <p><strong>Week 2(31/03 - 06/04)</strong></p>
			  <p><strong>Our Actions</strong></p>
			  <p>This week was a key moment in our marketing campaign. Our goal was to show our audience what our brand stands for, our style, personality, and values. We didn’t just want to promote a product, like explained in our strategy, we wanted to build a brand identity. We continued using humor and satire, especially by playing with the brand name to grab attention and create a memorable tone. We posted four times on Instagram and three times on TikTok. To test what works best, we shared posts at 3 PM in the first half of the week and at 4 PM in the second half, based on research showing both are strong posting times.</p>

			   <p><strong>What We Learned</strong></p>
			  <p>This week, we saw much better results on Instagram compared to TikTok. One of our TikTok posts was removed, which likely affected our overall performance there. From this, we learned that Instagram is more stable and predictable, making it easier to plan and execute posts. After testing both 3 pm and 4 pm posting times, we also found that 4 pm worked best for us.</p>
			  
			  
			    <p><strong>Week 3(7/04 - 13/04)</strong></p>
			  <p><strong>Our Actions</strong></p>
			  <p>This week, we took a more straightforward approach, focusing on clearly communicating what we do and what our work is all about. We made one Instagram post highlighting this and posted it at 4 pm, staying consistent with our previous successful timing.Since we had already achieved our objectives and engagement was very low we decided not to post on TikTok this week.</p>

          </table>
			  
			   <p><strong>What We Learned</strong></p>
			  <p>This post reached far fewer people and performed much worse than our previous ones, which we believe is because it was more formal and less engaging. We learned that our previous approach, more light and humorous, resonated better with our audience. Moving forward, we'll stick to that style for our posts to maintain higher engagement.</p>
			  
			   <p><strong>Week 4 (14/04 - 20/04)</strong></p>
			  <p><strong>Our Actions</strong></p>
			  <p>This week, we decided to go back to our original, funnier approach for both Instagram and TikTok posts. We prepared both photo/slides and video posts, using trending adventurous music to match our style. For our first post, we went for a clickbait approach to grab as much attention as possible, while still staying true to our brand values. We stuck with our usual posting time of 4 pm for all posts throughout the week.</p>

			   <p><strong>What We Learned</strong></p>
			  <p>Our video-style posts performed much better than the photo/slides posts on both TikTok and Instagram, likely due to the use of trending music. We learned that video posts have a different impact compared to photo/slides posts in terms of engagement. Additionally, we discovered that on Instagram, most views came from returning accounts, while on TikTok, the majority of views were from new users discovering our content.</p>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
			  
          <p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
			  <p>For this project, we learned a lot about how social media marketing works, but also how variable and unpredictable it can be. Early on, just after the first week, we had already reached our objectives, which was a huge surprise and a great sign of success. However, as we continued, we realized that different platforms have their own dynamics, and what works on one may not necessarily work on the other. We saw how trends, timing, and even the style of content, comical or formal, could have a big impact on the results. While we had some unexpected setbacks, like the removal of a TikTok post, we also experienced great success with content that truly resonated with our audience. However, we do feel disappointed, as we believe four weeks wasn’t enough to gain truly valuable insights and build a more consistent marketing strategy. With more time to analyze and understand the types of posts that worked best, we could have built a more solid and authentic brand presence. Unfortunately, with the limited time we had, it was impossible to form a consistent audience or get an in-depth understanding of how to best connect with them.</p>
			  
			  <p><strong>Future Recommendations</strong></p>
			  
			   <p>To ensure better results, we believe that it is crucial to extend the campaign to at least 8 weeks to gather more insights, build a consistent audience, and refine strategies. Also later on, we found that video posts and reels worked better in terms of views and engagement than static images, so focus more on those moving forward. Additionally, experiment more on TikTok to discover the best content type for that platform. Consistency is key, so continue posting regularly and analyzing data to improve content. This approach will help build a solid brand presence and reach the target audience more effectively.</p>
			 <p>For that campaign, new objectives could be:.</p>
			    <p>Reach Objectives: Reach 1500 people in 8 weeks on Instagram/Reach 1500 people in 8 weeks on TikTok </p>
			  <p>Response Objectives: Reach 200 followers on Instagram /Have at least 5 posts with 50 likes on Instagram/Have at least one post with 100 likes </p> 
			   <p>Affect Objectives: Give the target group a sense of nostalgia and empower them to make more trips and enjoy the van life (shouldn't change) </p> 
			  
			  <p><strong>Would be done differently</strong></p>
